AM I RESPONSIVE IMAGE

Welcome Damhan91,

Reef Gardens has been built for my 5th and final project for Code Institutes Full Stack Software Development program. Reef Gardens is an E-commerce Website, where customer can purchase and browse for either captive breed Marine fish or corals. The website provides a list of products that can be conveniently purchased from the store. After the user has selocted their goods, they are taken through the order confirmation process and collection of payment. This system is implemented using python and the Django framework.

## User Experince

**Primary Goals**
  
**As a first time user, I want to:**

  * View the details of a single products, so I can understand the details, price and rating if any.
  * Sort the view of products by price low to high. So that I can make an informed purchased based on price.
  * Sort the view of products by price high to low. So that I can make an informed purchased based on price.

  * Edit and update existing store products to change pricing, images etc.
  * Delete items from the store if neccassry.
  
**Business Model**
I have chosen a B2C ( Businees to Customer) business model. This is more straight forward for the end user as they only have one point of contact. Having the business model B2C also allows for the customer to get the best price possible as you do not have to pay a middle man.

The business flow is as follows:

  * Reef Gardens breed fish and cultivate corals (captive breding program)
  * The products are then set up on the website for the user to purchase.
  
**Marketing**
For marketing Reef Gardens will use a FaceBook Business Page. Reef Gardens will also use Mailchimp for user who wish to sign up. THe user will be given a notification once they have succesfuly sign up.

**Search Engine Optimisation**

I researcherd some of the most popular words that is used for searching for tropical fish. I included them in the title and description.

## Release History

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**September 1 2021:** Remove `PGHOSTADDR` environment variable.

**July 19 2021:** Remove `font_fix` script now that the terminal font issue is fixed.

**July 2 2021:** Remove extensions that are not available in Open VSX.

**June 30 2021:** Combined the P4 and P5 templates into one file, added the uptime script. See the FAQ at the end of this file.

**June 10 2021:** Added: `font_fix` script and alias to fix the Terminal font issue

**May 10 2021:** Added `heroku_config` script to allow Heroku API key to be stored as an environment variable.

**April 7 2021:** Upgraded the template for VS Code instead of Theia.

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

## FAQ about the uptime script

**Why have you added this script?**

It will help us to calculate how many running workspaces there are at any one time, which greatly helps us with cost and capacity planning. It will help us decide on the future direction of our cloud-based IDE strategy.

**How will this affect me?**

For everyday usage of Gitpod, it doesn’t have any effect at all. The script only captures the following data:

- An ID that is randomly generated each time the workspace is started.
- The current date and time
- The workspace status of “started” or “running”, which is sent every 5 minutes.

It is not possible for us or anyone else to trace the random ID back to an individual, and no personal data is being captured. It will not slow down the workspace or affect your work.

**So….?**

We want to tell you this so that we are being completely transparent about the data we collect and what we do with it.

**Can I opt out?**

Yes, you can. Since no personally identifiable information is being captured, we'd appreciate it if you let the script run; however if you are unhappy with the idea, simply run the following commands from the terminal window after creating the workspace, and this will remove the uptime script:

```
pkill uptime.sh
rm .vscode/uptime.sh
```

**Anything more?**

Yes! We'd strongly encourage you to look at the source code of the `uptime.sh` file so that you know what it's doing. As future software developers, it will be great practice to see how these shell scripts work.

Happy coding!
