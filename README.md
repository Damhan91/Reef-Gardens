Reef Gardens has been built for my 5th and final project for Code Institutes Full Stack Software Development program. Reef Gardens is an E-commerce Website, where customer can purchase and browse for either captive breed Marine fish or corals. The website provides a list of products that can be conveniently purchased from the store. After the user has selocted their goods, they are taken through the order confirmation process and collection of payment. This system is implemented using python and the Django framework.

## Business Model
I have chosen a B2C ( Businees to Customer) business model. This is more straight forward for the end user as they only have one point of contact. Having the business model B2C also allows for the customer to get the best price possible as you do not have to pay a middle man.

The business flow is as follows:

  * Reef Gardens breed fish and cultivate corals (captive breding program)
  * The products are then set up on the website for the user to purchase.
  
**Marketing**
For marketing Reef Gardens will use a FaceBook Business Page. Reef Gardens will also use Mailchimp for user who wish to sign up. THe user will be given a notification once they have succesfuly sign up.

**Search Engine Optimisation**

I researcherd some of the most popular words that is used for searching for tropical fish. I included them in the title and description.
