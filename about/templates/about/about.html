            <h3>Locally Breed</h3>
            <p>These fish and corals are lcoally breed in Ireland, which means that they do not have to travel far to
                get to you. You will recieve a more healthy and less stressed fish, this will help you with introducing
                the new fish into your aquarium and set you up for success</p>

            <h3>Sustainability</h3>
            <p>Sustainability is a big factor for us here at Reef Gardens. We want to make sure that each and every
                hobiest can enjoy the hobby knowiong that they have not taken any of their fisd or corals from the wild.
                Each fish and coral is breed here at Reef Gardens. Captive breeding helps alleviate collection pressure
                on wild fish and coral populations and the reefs they inhabit are left alone.</p>

            <h3>Accustomed to captivity</h3>
            <p>Having been reared under aquarium conditions and raised on prepared aquarium foods, captive-bred
                specimens are simply much better suited to life in water-filled glass or acrylic boxes and much easier
                to feed than their wild-collected counterparts are.</p>
